/**
 * Discord Integration (DCIntegration) adapter. Talks to its real public API
 * (de.erdbeerbaerlp.dcintegration.common.*), compiled against a compileOnly CurseMaven
 * dependency — only ever touched after ModList confirms DCIntegration is actually loaded,
 * so the mod remains fully optional at runtime.
 *
 * Unlike SDLink/Mc2Discord, DCIntegration mixins directly into vanilla chat/join/leave/
 * command handling (ChatMixin, PlayerManagerMixin, NetworkHandlerMixin, CommandManagerMixin)
 * and relays those events to Discord entirely on its own, to whatever channel its own config
 * (general.botChannel / advanced.chatOutputChannelID) points at — this adapter has no
 * visibility into or control over that path. onPlayerJoin/onPlayerQuit are deliberately left
 * unimplemented, since calling DiscordIntegration.sendMessage() for those would double-post
 * alongside DCIntegration's own mixin-driven relay.
 *
 * onPlayerChat IS implemented, but ONLY acts when a NeoEssentials chat channel has a specific
 * discord.channelId configured (e.g. a private staff channel) — that is additive, not
 * duplicative, since DCIntegration's own native relay has no concept of NeoEssentials channels
 * and only ever posts to its own single configured channel. When discordChannelId is null (the
 * channel is configured to just use "the default" — most channels), this deliberately does
 * nothing at all, exactly as before, to avoid double-posting against DCIntegration's own
 * mixin-driven relay of the SAME message.

     * on first invocation — and this happens regardless of any {@code ModList.isLoaded()} guard
     * inside the SAME class, since the guard is only checked once the method actually runs, long
     * after the class (and everything it references) was already required to resolve. Before
     * this split, simply constructing {@code new DCIntegrationAdapter()} in
     * {@code ChatIntegrationManager.initialize()} — which happens unconditionally on every
     * server start — crashed the entire server with a {@code NoClassDefFoundError} on any pack
     * where DCIntegration isn't installed (or an older/incompatible JDA elsewhere on the
     * classpath lacks this newer channel-type package), because DCIntegrationAdapter itself
     * used to reference these types directly.
