## [1.0.6] — 2026-08-27

### Added
- Sidebar scoreboard system — `/scoreboard` with config-driven boards, conditions,
  animation, group/player overrides, a toggle command, and a dashboard endpoint.
- General leaderboard system — `/leaderboard` (`/lb`), with `money`/`kills`/`mob_kills`/
  `playtime` boards and `{leaderboard_<board>:<rank>:name|value}` placeholders.
- Leaderboard boards are now config-driven (`leaderboard.json`) — register any vanilla
  per-player stat (blocks mined, mobs killed, distance, etc.) as a board via config, plus
  "custom" point-total boards (`/leaderboard admin set|add|reset|create|delete`) and a
  `LeaderboardAPI` for other mods to register their own boards.
- `/leaderboard hologram create <board> <id> [lines]` — generates a ranked leaderboard
  hologram in one command; the lines keep updating live on their own.
- Leaderboards can now rank non-players — a new `shop_sales` board ranks sign/chest and NPC
  shops by total revenue, shown by shop name instead of a player name.
- Per-board `refreshInterval` in `leaderboard.json` (was a fixed 60s for every board).
- Leaderboard styling: automatic per-rank medal/color placeholders (`:medal`/`:rankcolor`),
  per-board `entryFormat`/`headerFormat` chat templates, and a new paginated GUI viewer
  (`/leaderboard <board> gui`) with real player heads and per-board icons.

### Fixed
- `/permissions group <group> setprefix|setsuffix` no longer shows a raw "unexpected
  error" when the internal permission manager isn't active (e.g. an external permissions
  plugin like LuckPerms is in use) — it now explains why instead.
- `{luckperms_group}`/`{luckperms_primary_group}`/`{ftbranks_rank}`/`{ftbranks_group}`
  placeholders no longer resolve to an empty string when LuckPerms/FTB Ranks is actually
  active — `prefix`/`suffix`/`displayname` variants were unaffected.
- Nicknamed players (`/nick`) now keep their permission-group prefix/suffix in the tab list —
  a nickname used to silently drop it the instant it was set, on any group.
- `PermissionAPI.getPrefix()`/`getSuffix()` now fall back to the internal permission system
  when LuckPerms/FTB Ranks has no opinion, matching `getGroupWeight()`/`getPrimaryGroup()`'s
  existing behavior. FTB Ranks servers previously got no prefix/suffix at all through this
  mod, ever; LuckPerms groups with no `prefix`/`suffix` meta set now fall back to an internal
  one too instead of showing nothing.
- Five more places had the identical internal-manager-only bug (found by auditing every
  remaining call site): the public `NeoEssentialsAPI` group lookup, the `{group}` placeholder,
  per-group tablist column bucketing, chat badge group gating, and player tags all silently
  fell back to `""`/`"default"` under LuckPerms/FTB Ranks — now fixed the same way.
- Config-version upgrades (the merge that adds new default keys/boards to an existing config
  on update) were silently failing on Windows — fixed. Also fixed new default boards (like
  `shop_sales`) not reaching an already-upgraded install even after that fix.
