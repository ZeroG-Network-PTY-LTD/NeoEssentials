## [1.0.6] — 2026-08-27

### Added
- Sidebar scoreboard system — `/scoreboard` with config-driven boards, conditions,
  animation, group/player overrides, a toggle command, and a dashboard endpoint.
- General leaderboard system — `/leaderboard` (`/lb`), with `money`/`kills`/`mob_kills`/
  `playtime` boards and `{leaderboard_<board>:<rank>:name|value}` placeholders.
- Leaderboard boards are now config-driven (`leaderboard.json`) — register any vanilla
  per-player stat (blocks mined, mobs killed, distance, etc.) as a board via config, plus
  "custom" point-total boards (`/leaderboard admin set|add|reset|create|delete`) and a
  `LeaderboardAPI` for other mods to register their own boards.
- `/leaderboard hologram create <board> <id> [lines]` — generates a ranked leaderboard
  hologram in one command; the lines keep updating live on their own.

### Fixed
- `/permissions group <group> setprefix|setsuffix` no longer shows a raw "unexpected
  error" when the internal permission manager isn't active (e.g. an external permissions
  plugin like LuckPerms is in use) — it now explains why instead.
- `{luckperms_group}`/`{luckperms_primary_group}`/`{ftbranks_rank}`/`{ftbranks_group}`
  placeholders no longer resolve to an empty string when LuckPerms/FTB Ranks is actually
  active — `prefix`/`suffix`/`displayname` variants were unaffected.
