# NeoEssentials — Changelog

Starting from **v1.0.6** — earlier history (v1.0.5.x and before) is not carried over.

**Minecraft 1.21.1 – 1.21.11 · NeoForge 21.1.179+**

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-08-27

### Added
- Sidebar scoreboard system — `/scoreboard` with config-driven boards, conditions,
  animation, group/player overrides, a toggle command, and a dashboard endpoint.
- General leaderboard system — `/leaderboard` (`/lb`), with `money`/`kills`/`mob_kills`/
  `playtime` boards and `{leaderboard_<board>:<rank>:name|value}` placeholders.

### Fixed
- `/permissions group <group> setprefix|setsuffix` no longer shows a raw "unexpected
  error" when the internal permission manager isn't active (e.g. an external permissions
  plugin like LuckPerms is in use) — it now explains why instead.
