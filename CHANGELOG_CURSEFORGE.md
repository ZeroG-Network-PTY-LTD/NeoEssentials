# NeoEssentials — Changelog

**Minecraft 1.21.1 – 1.21.11 · NeoForge 21.1.179+**

---

## 1.0.2.6+build.15 — 2026-04-01

### 🐛 Bug Fixes — Split Config System

- **Fixed** Split config files (main.json, chat.json, etc.) never being created on fresh server installs. `createSplitConfigsFromJar()` previously looked for files that don't exist in the JAR — it now correctly extracts sections from the bundled monolithic `config.json`.
- **Fixed** `main.json` being overwritten with only one section (e.g. only `modules` with `logging`/`permissions`/`kits` lost) when `ensureSplitConfigsUpToDate()` processed section entries instead of file entries.
- **Fixed** The `economy` config section (currency, starting balance, sell multiplier) being completely absent from split configs.

### ✨ New Features — Split Config System

- **Added** `/neoe config validate` — checks all 10 split files for missing files, parse errors, and missing sections with clear remediation hints.
- **Added** `/neoe config repair` — auto-regenerates missing split files and fills missing sections from JAR defaults without touching existing values.
- **Added** `/neoe config status` — visual ✔/✘ overview of all split config files and overall health.
- **Added** Boxed startup error messages when split config files cannot be regenerated, including exact command to fix.
- **Added** `SplitConfigs.md` wiki — full documentation on the split config system.

## 1.0.2.6+build.12 — 2026-04-01


### ✨ New Features

- **MOTD – Multi-Profile Support** — The MOTD system now supports multiple named profiles. Create, delete, switch, and inspect profiles with `/motd profile list|create|delete|switch|info`. Each profile has its own message, author, and timestamp, all persisted to `config/neoessentials/motd_data.json`.
- **MOTD – Auto-Rotation** — Automatically cycle through all MOTD profiles on a configurable interval using `/motd rotation enable <minutes>`. Disable with `/motd rotation disable`, or advance manually with `/motd rotation next`.
- **MOTD – Dashboard API** — Full REST endpoint at `/api/motd` in the web dashboard for managing profiles, switching the active profile, controlling rotation, and broadcasting to online players.
- **MOTD – Error Feedback** — Save and load failures now show a descriptive error in-game instead of silently resetting. `/motd reload` reports the exact I/O problem if the data file cannot be read.
- **Legacy Migration** — Existing single-MOTD `motd_data.json` files are automatically promoted to the multi-profile format on first load with no data loss.

### 🔒 New Permissions
- `neoessentials.motd.profile` — Manage MOTD profiles (default: `false`)
- `neoessentials.motd.rotation` — Control auto-rotation (default: `false`)

## 1.0.2.6+build.5 — 2026-04-01


### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Config** – Fixed `ClassCastException` crash in all kit commands (`/kit`, `/kits`, `/listkits`) when split configs are enabled. Kit settings now live in `main.json`, separate from kit definitions in `kits.json`.
- **Config** – Fixed `getConfig("chat")` and similar section-name lookups throwing `FileNotFoundException`, breaking chat formatting, badges, resource packs, and more.
- **Permissions** – Fixed server OPs being denied commands when FTB Ranks or LuckPerms is installed. OP bypass is now a universal safety net regardless of permission back-end.
- **Permissions** – Fixed FTB Ranks adapter crashing with `NoSuchMethodException` on FTB Ranks 2101.1.x. Updated reflection logic probes the new API format automatically.
- **ChestShop** – Fixed Admin Shops created with `?` (pending item) showing "This shop is not yet ready" when the admin tried to assign the item. Any player with `neoessentials.shop.create.admin` can now assign the item.
- **Help** – Fixed `/help 2` (page numbers) showing "No command found" due to a conflict with vanilla's `/help` command registration.
- **Moderation** – Fixed `/unban` not detecting bans issued by vanilla `/ban` or operator tools. NeoEssentials now syncs with the vanilla ban list in both directions.
- **Rules** – Fixed `/rules` showing "Rules are not set" on servers that had rules configured in the legacy `rules.json` file from older builds. Auto-migration to `rules_data.json` is now performed.
- **MOTD** – Fixed MOTD resetting on server restart due to an incorrect save path. Now uses `ResourceUtil` consistently with all other data files.
